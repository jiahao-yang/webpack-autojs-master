# KISS Principle (Keep It Simple and Stupid 简单至上原则)
- Always prefer simple, clear solutions over complex ones.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions, overengineering, or premature optimization.
- Write code and docs that are easy to read, understand, and maintain.
- Use straightforward logic and naming; minimize clever tricks.
- If a simple approach works, choose it—even if it seems "too easy".

# Don't rush into code implementation (不要急于编码实现)
- Design discussions should come before code implementation, especially when there are multiple possible approaches. Start coding after my confirmation.
- Only proceed to code for simple enhancements or clear bug fixes without design ambiguity.
- For complex features or architectural changes, compare options and confirm direction before coding.
- This ensures thoughtful, maintainable solutions and avoids unnecessary rework.

# Update Design.md timely

- After any major updates or important code changes, always update the `Design.md` file as soon as possible. But please keep the file nice and concise without redudant details, especially code snippets.
- Document new features, architectural changes, and important implementation details in `Design.md` for future reference and team knowledge sharing. Dont need to add issues/fixes into the doc.
- Include rationale (理由/reasoning) for significant decisions and any relevant diagrams or pseodo code if helpful.
- Regularly review `Design.md` to ensure it accurately reflects the current system design and major workflows.


# Code Commit Message Rules

## When to Generate Commit Messages
**Auto-generate** commit messages for:
- ✅ Feature additions and removals
- ✅ Bug fixes and improvements  
- ✅ Refactoring and optimizations
- ✅ Configuration changes
- ✅ API changes and database modifications

**Skip** commit message generation for:
- ⏭️ Trivial changes (typos, minor formatting)
- ⏭️ Question-only conversations
- ⏭️ Pure information requests
- ⏭️ Single-line fixes

## Commit Message Format
- **Language**: English only
- **Length**: Maximum 5 lines
- **Style**: Conventional commits with emoji
- **Structure**: 
  ```
  ✨ Clear summary of main change
  
  - Specific improvement 1
  - Specific improvement 2  
  - Specific improvement 3
  ```

## Emoji Convention
- ✨ New features
- 🐛 Bug fixes
- 🚀 Performance improvements
- 📝 Documentation
- 🎨 UI/UX improvements
- 🔧 Configuration changes
- ♻️ Refactoring
- 🗑️ Removing code/features

## Examples
```
✨ Add user authentication with JWT tokens

- Implement login/logout endpoints
- Add password hashing with bcrypt
- Create protected route middleware
- Add user session management
```
